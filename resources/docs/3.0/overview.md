## Overview

`vue-context` provides a simple yet flexible context menu for Vue. It is styled for the standard `<ul>` tag, but any menu template can be used.
The menu is lightweight with its only dependency being `vue-clickaway`. The menu has some basic styles applied to it but they can be easily 
overridden by your own styles.
<br><br>
The menu disappears when you expect by utilizing `vue-clickaway` and it also optionally disappears when clicked on.
